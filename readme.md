# BLACKPINK WEBSITE

This assignment enables me to design a website for a Korean girl band called Blackpink. This project aims to bring as many people as the world can possibly get to know about their idols and connecting the fans worldwide together and also selling the band’s official merchandise are the business aspects we offer to make life more fun and challenging.

## Design Process
The main reason for designing this website is to get the existing Blackpink fans more engaged with the band and also to attract new fans in the long run. During the process of designing this website, a decisive idea crossed my mind where the theme colours of real black and bright pink with some shades can help users feel more comfortable while they are visiting the website. Users are free to take a stroll on the website to enjoy many inspirational Blackpink posters, cool animated videos, informative YouTube videos, and events that they certainly don’t want to miss. In the homepage area, the ‘Member’ feature helps our users to focus on the detail of each member and their achievements. In the ‘Events’ feature, a huge poster of their world tour is intended as the main attraction where details of their upcoming concerts are clearly displayed for them. There is also the ‘Ticket Information’ icon, that once users click on it, they will automatically be redirected to Blackpink's official website where they are able to purchase the ticket, right from their idols’ official website. On top of each space for the merchandise, I inserted only valuable products to enable Blackpink fans to associate more with their idols. Further, the products are also featured with the price tag and the name of the merchandise itself that users can refer to when they order. The login feature shouldn’t be left behind as both login and signup boxes are decorated with the theme colours of black and pink.
- As a loyal user, I want to know literally everything about Blackpink concerts and events, so that I will be more well-informed with thorough detail information about the locations, dates and times.
- As a loyal user, I need to sign up and log in to get weekly updates from everything related to Blackpink.
- As a diehard user, I want to know all about Blackpink so that I can associate myself with them in my daily life.
- As a new user, I need to know the price of the merchandise I truly am interested in, so that I know how much I need to save to purchase Blackpink Official merchandise.

## Testing

Login and Sign up form:
When we went to the ‘Login’ page, if the user submitted an invalid email address or leave the password box empty, it showed an error message afterwards.

In the Sign-up form, when a new user left the form empty, an error message would show up as well.

Another bug appeared when I tried to switch from the Login form to the Sign-up form. In the beginning, it only appeared the Login form without the Sign-up form. I have tried a number of methods in the last two weeks until I finally found out what the problem was.
